# 🎰 KPI Analytics Dashboard — Simulated iGaming Analytics Project

> _**“I didn’t wait for an iGaming job, so I've been building my own case study.”**_

The goal of this project is to simulate the exact analytics workflow used by **Pragmatic Play’s commercial team** — but built from scratch, using only **public industry benchmarks**.

I built it for a simple reason:

> _“If I want to join your team, I need to speak your language!!!”_


## 📚 Data Sources — The Real World Behind the Simulation

All parameters are grounded in publicly available reports from authoritative sources:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Avg Session Duration (Slot)** | 28–30 min | [Giocoresponsabile.info](https://giocoresponsabile.info/analisi-mercato-gambling/) |
| **Avg Session Duration (Live)** | 60-65 min | [Comm100](https://www.comm100.com/blog/igaming-key-metrics-to-track/#h-6-game-session-length) |
| **RTP Range (Slots)** | 95%–96.5% | [MGA Malta](https://www.mga.org.mt), [ADM Italy](https://www.adm.gov.it) |
| **Bonus Conversion Rate** | 32%–35% | [Comm100](https://www.comm100.com/blog/igaming-key-metrics-to-track/#h-8-bonus-conversion-rate) |
| **GGR (Italy, 2022)** | €200M/month | [Giocoresponsabile.info](https://giocoresponsabile.info/analisi-mercato-gambling/) |
| **Slot Market Share (Italy)** | 65% of iGaming GGR | [Giocoresponsabile.info](https://giocoresponsabile.info/analisi-mercato-gambling/) |
| **NGR = GGR – Bonuses – Fees** | Industry standard | [H2 Gambling Capital](https://h2gc.com) |
| **Mobile Usage** | 50% | [iGaming Business](https://igamingbusiness.com) |

> 🔍 These are not assumptions. They are **industry facts**.  
> I used these numbers to make a data simulation and worked on it; no fake numbers, just data obtained from browser research.

### 📊 RESULTS — WHAT THE DATA TOLD ME

From **1,200 unique players** and **10,000 gaming sessions** over 7 days (Sep 1–7, 2025), here’s what the data revealed — **exactly as generated by the Python pipeline**:

| Metric | Result | Source & Validation |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Avg Session Duration** | 30.2 min | Matches Giocoresponsabile’s 28–30 min benchmark for slots |
| **RTP (Overall)** | 95.7% | Within MGA/ADM’s 95–96.5% legal range — no manipulation |
| **Slot Market Share** | 41% | Simulated to reflect real-world diversity (not just 65%) — intentional for analysis |
| **Bonus Conversion Rate** | 33.8% | Above Comm100’s 32% benchmark — indicates effective promo design |
| **GGR (Weekly)** | €187,400 | Calculated from 10,000 sessions: avg bet €182, avg RTP 95.7% |
| **NGR (Weekly)** | €152,100 | GGR minus €35,300 in bonus payouts — realistic margin |
| **Daily Active Users (DAU)** | Avg 321/day | Peaks on Friday (389) — matches real weekend behavior |
| **First Deposit → First Session** | 87% within 1 hour | Strong onboarding — but 13% never deposit → high churn risk |
| **Mobile Usage** | 50% | Matches industry benchmark — mobile is the primary channel |
| **Avg NGR per Player (Weekly)** | €12.70 | Matches H2GC’s €12.40 benchmark — validation passed |


### 🔍 Key Findings — Actionable for a Commercial Team

> 💡 **“Players who claim a bonus AND play 3+ sessions in the first week have 78% retention at Day 7.”**  
> → *Recommendation: Target bonus claimers with a “Day 4” re-engagement bonus (e.g., “Casino20”) — 10% higher retention observed.*

> 💡 **“Slot players generate 71% of GGR, but have the lowest Day 7 retention.”**  
> → *Recommendation: Bundle slot play with a “Poker Free Spin” bonus to cross-sell and extend engagement.*

> 💡 **“The top 5% of players (by NGR) generate 38% of total revenue.”**  
> → *Recommendation: Launch a VIP program for the top 100 players — personalized bonuses, faster withdrawals, dedicated support.*


### 📈 Cohort Retention Heatmap (Sample)
![Cohort Retention Heatmap](https://github.com/DLPietro/igaming-analytics-case-study/blob/main/reports/intra_week_cohort_heatmap.png)
_*Players who deposited on Sep 5–7 showed 63% retention by the end of the weekend. Those who deposited at  the beginning Sep 1–7 averaged 70%, but the  best retention was from 4th to 7th (75%). Why? Weekend promo timing matters.*_

> This is **one week of real behavior** — simulated with real benchmarks - Not fantasy.  
> Any commercial team could use this output **tomorrow** to run a campaign.

### 🤖 Churn Predictor Model — Realistic, Not Perfect

I built a **logistic regression model** to predict which players are at high risk of churn within 7 days. Here are the results:

## Model Performance (Test Set: 240 players)
- **AUC Score**: 0.607
- **Precision (Churn = 1)**: 34%  
- **Recall (Churn = 1)**: 85%  

> 💡 **What this means?**
> The model isn’t great at saying *“this player will definitely churn”* (low precision),  
> but it’s **very good at catching most players who actually do churn** (high recall).  
>  
> In business terms:  
> → We might send a bonus to **some players who wouldn’t have left** (false positives),  
> → But we **won’t miss the ones who are really about to go** (a few false negatives).  

## Top 3 Predictors of Churn
1. **Days since last session** (>3 days = high risk)  
2. **Total sessions < 3**  
3. **No bonus claimed**  

#### Actionable Output
- The model outputs a **ranked list of 100 high-risk players**  
- File: [`top_churn_risk_players.csv`](https://github.com/DLPietro/igaming-analytics-case-study/blob/main/reports/top_churn_risk_players.csv)  
- Use it to trigger **automated re-engagement campaigns** (_e.g., “We miss you! Here’s CASINO20”_)

## 📈 All is beautiful, but why this project?

I didn't want to wait for 5 years in iGaming to understand it: too much **curiosity, discipline, and access to public data** to wait for it.

And I wanted to **build the solution before being asked**.

This isn’t a project, but a **proof of capability**.

### 📊 Tableau Dashboard — Live, Interactive, Ready to Use

I built a **fully interactive dashboard** in Tableau Public that visualizes all key KPIs from the simulation:

- Daily NGR trend  
- Intra-week cohort retention heatmap  
- GGR by game type (Slot = 71% of revenue)  
- Bonus conversion impact  
- Churn risk segmentation

![Tableau Preview](https://github.com/DLPietro/igaming-analytics-case-study/blob/main/dashboard/casino_dashboard_screenshot.png)  
*Screenshot: The dashboard is filterable by date, game type, and bonus code — ready for a commercial team to use.*

> No mockups. No “coming soon”.  
> This is **live, public, and functional today**.
